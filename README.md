### Hi there 
I'm francesco, I got a master degree in mathematics with a thesis about persistent homology and machine learning appliations. 
I'm currently working as data scientist, and I'm deeply passionate about current research in AI. 
In my free time I like to learn about ML concepts and possibly code to better grasp their inner meaning. Check it out the geoviz repo!
