### Hi there!

I'm francesco, I got a master degree in mathematics with a thesis about persistent homology (in the profile picture) and its machine learning applications. 
I'm currently working as data scientist. 
I'm deeply curious about current state of the art of the AI world and in my free time I like to learn about ML concepts and possibly code to better grasp their inner meaning.
